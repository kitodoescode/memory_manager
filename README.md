# memory_manager
```cpp
// memory manager
// a single-file, memory management library made specifically for windows cheat tools wanting to manipulate memory with ease
// this library uses indirect syscalls for all its functions such as read, write, allocate, etc.
// includes a roblox version of the memory manager for some roblox-specific extras such as get_version(), read_string() etc.
// also includes a syscall stub parser to get syscall indexes and addresses in runtime instead of static values
```
